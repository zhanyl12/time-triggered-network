WARNING:ConstraintSystem:137 - Constraint <TNM_NET = sys_clk_pin;> [udp.ucf(2)]:
   No appropriate instances for the TNM constraint are driven by "fpga_gclk".

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:56 - Constraint <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD
   sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [udp.ucf(3)]: Unable to find an active 'TNM' or
   'TimeGrp' constraint named 'sys_clk_pin'.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:191 - The TNM 'sys_clk_pin', does not directly or
   indirectly drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMS and cannot be actively
   used by the referencing Period constraint 'TS_sys_clk_pin'. If clock manager
   blocks are directly or indirectly driven, a new TNM constraint will not be
   derived even though the referencing constraint is a PERIOD constraint unless
   an output of the clock manager drives flip-flops, latches or RAMs. This TNM
   is used in the following user PERIOD specification:
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [udp.ucf(3)]

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [udp.ucf(3)]
